# Smart Home System - WPF Project with .NET Remoting 🏠🌟

## Project Overview 📝

The "Smart Home System" project is a WPF application developed as part of the "Component-Oriented Programming" course. The project aims to create an innovative and intelligent home automation system, providing users with the ability to enhance the security, comfort, and convenience of their home. Leveraging 💻 .NET Remoting technology, the project seamlessly connects various components to create a comprehensive and integrated smart home experience.

### Key Features 🚀

- **Face ID Door Opening** 👤🚪: The project offers a secure and futuristic way of opening doors using facial recognition technology. Users can register their face, and the system grants access only to recognized individuals.

- **Temperature and Humidity Control** 🌡️💧: The application allows users to monitor and control the indoor temperature and humidity levels for optimal comfort.

- **Smart Device Control** 📺🔌: Gain full control over smart devices within your home, including 📺 TVs, 🧊 refrigerators, 💡 lights, ❄️ air-conditioners, 🚪 room doors, and 📷 cameras. Remotely manage their functions and settings through a user-friendly interface.

## How to Run the Project ▶️

1. Ensure you have .NET 5 or an earlier version of .NET Framework installed on your machine. Please note that .NET Remoting is deprecated and only available in .NET Framework versions.

2. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

3. Open the project solution in Visual Studio, ensuring you're using .NET 5 or an earlier version compatible with .NET Remoting.

4. Build and compile the solution to ensure that all dependencies are resolved.

5. Run the application, and you will be greeted with the intuitive user interface of the Smart Home System.

6. Navigate through the different sections of the application to explore and interact with its features.

7. Experiment with the Face ID door opening, temperature and humidity control, and the management of various smart devices.

8. Observe the seamless communication between components achieved through .NET Remoting, providing an integrated and connected smart home experience.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **NET Framework 5**: The project is built on the .NET Framework 5, providing a robust foundation for developing Windows applications.
- **C#**: The primary programming language used for the logic and functionality of the application.
- **WPF** (Windows Presentation Foundation): Utilized for creating the interactive and visually appealing user interface.
- **.NET Remoting**: Used for inter-process communication between components, enabling seamless interaction within the smart home system.
- **MySQ**L: The chosen database management system, responsible for securely storing and retrieving data related to device settings, user preferences, and security protocols.
- **Dapper**: Leveraged as the data access library for simplifying database operations and enhancing performance.
- **EMGU CV**: Employed for implementing the Face ID functionality, allowing secure door opening through facial recognition.

The combination of these technologies forms a powerful stack that brings the smart home concept to life, offering security, convenience, and efficiency in managing your home environment. 🏠🔒🌐
